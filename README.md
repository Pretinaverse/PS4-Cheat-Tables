# PS4-Cheat-Tables
<b>PS4 Games Cheat Tables made with PS4 Cheater Neo</b>

Here I plan to compile the cheats I make <b>for my personal use</b>, using <b><a href="https://github.com/avan06/PS4CheaterNeo">PS4 Cheater Neo</b></a>, by <b><a href="https://github.com/avan06">avan06</a></b>, with <b><a href="https://github.com/GoldHEN/ps4debug">ps4debug</a></b> by Ctn & SiSTRo. I don't play much, so I don't plan to update very often. I also won't accept requests, nor will I create trainers since I don't have the time or the desire to learn how to use tools like Reaper or MultiTrainer.

Right now I'm using <b>PS4 Cheater Neo v1.0.5</b> with <b>ps4debug v1.1.17</b>.

<b>My firmware is 5.05, so I can't guarantee that my tables will work in other firmwares</b>.
